# PlayWright-Linux-DotNet
Demo of PlayWright Linux DotNet 

## Introduction
For this video I wanna change it up a little bit.

We've already had tools running in node, python, java, webbased.. so why not
change it up a little bit by using something different.

Since we are looking at PlayWright, which is developped by Microsoft, why don't
we look into that eco system for a little.

Don't worry I'm not going to run it in Windows alone, since my channel likes to
advocate Linux as a allround developer system I will run PlayWright in DotNet in
Linux.

To demonstrate how to get started with DotNet on Fedora I will head over to the
awesome Fedora magazine where there was an article some time ago that showed
how to get started with DotNet on Fedora.
